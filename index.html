                        This has long been America’s favorite pizza topping. 
                        What is pepperoni made of? It’s cured sausage made of pork and beef that has been seasoned with spices like paprika, 
                        chili pepper, cayenne, black pepper and even fennel and allspice. 
                        Pepperoni varies in size from thick or thin flat laid pepperoni and cup and 
                        char pepperoni to cubed pepperoni and Old World pepperoni.

                        If you are from the Midwest, sausage is often a go-to pizza topping. 
                        If you’re in Chicago, sausage is the No. 1 pizza topping in the land. 
                        Sausage varies widely in type and style. While there are sausage links like kielbasa and andouille, 
                        we tend to think of the pizza topping as ground sausage. 
                        It is flavored several ways, from fennel and sage to Italian spiced.

                        Mushrooms have remained a top pizza topping consistently, and for good reason. Varies are abundant. 
                        They can either stand out on a pizza or complement other pizza ingredients. 
                        The most common mushrooms used on pizza are white button mushrooms, followed by cremini and portobellos.
